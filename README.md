Welcome to the **Procedural Generation with Python and Tkinter** repository! This project showcases a simple procedural terrain generation application built with Python and the Tkinter library. The application allows you to generate and visualize terrains with customizable settings.

## Features

- **Terrain Generation:** Utilizes Perlin noise algorithm to generate random terrains based on user-defined parameters.
- **Color Mapping:** Assigns colors to different altitude layers, providing a visually appealing representation of the terrain.
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Built with Tkinter, the GUI provides sliders and buttons for easy adjustment of generation settings.
- **Save Functionality:** Allows users to save the generated terrain as an image file.

## Getting Started

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Eeman1113/Procedural_Generation_Python.git
    cd Procedural_Generation_Python
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install Pillow numpy noise
    ```

3. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python High_Level_Islands.py
    ```

## Configuration

Adjust the terrain generation settings using the sliders in the GUI. Customize parameters such as scale, octaves, persistence, lacunarity, and more to create diverse and unique terrains.

## Save Your Creation

After generating a terrain, use the "Save Image" button to save your creation as a PNG file. Choose a directory and filename, and your generated terrain will be preserved for future use or sharing.
